WIC Interpreter in C
========

This project exists to directly execute WIC programs in C.
Wren is a small imperative teaching language and WIC stands for
Wren Intermediate Code, and is just a low level intermediate version
of wren.

It should be noted this project is a programming assignment
for CS 3490 (Programming Languages), taught by Dr. Fenwick at 
App State. 

I am really only putting this on GitHub to learn Git and the whole system 
through a project.
